# Simple_CSS
This is a simple and basic web site using css. This web site is not responsive, it was developed only for practice simple css. I won't develop this README, but you can see the result of my first steps here.  https://alissoninacio1.github.io/Simple_CSS/
Other repositories will be created with complete projects in this GitHub profile.
